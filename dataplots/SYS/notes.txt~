01 - Lattice depth 
==================


This keeps the green compensation constant, so as the depth is varied, not only
the lattice depth is changing, but the density distribution changes 
considerably due to the different compensation.  Since compensation is a very
critical variable, then a small change in the lattice depth can cause a large
change in Spi.
